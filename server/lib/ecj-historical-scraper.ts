Generate realistic data for all 14 Jamaica parishes:
Kingston, St. Andrew, St. Thomas, Portland, St. Mary, St. Ann, Trelawny, St. James, Hanover, Westmoreland, St. Elizabeth, Manchester, Clarendon, St. Catherine

Use these realistic patterns:
- Local government elections: 35-45% turnout
- General elections: 55-70% turnout  
- Rural parishes: slightly lower turnout
- Urban parishes: slightly higher turnout
- Earlier elections (1947-1980): lower overall participation
- Modern elections (1990+): higher participation

For each parish, include:
- registeredVoters (realistic for parish size)
- totalVotesCast (based on turnout percentage)
- turnout (decimal 0-1)
- 3-5 polling stations with realistic data

Format as JSON with structure:
{
  "election": {"year": "${election.year}", "title": "${election.title}", "type": "${election.type}", "date": "YYYY-MM-DD"},
  "parishes": [parish objects],
